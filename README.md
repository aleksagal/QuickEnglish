### Introduction
```QuickEnglish``` is a web application that allows users to take an English language test.
The application consists of two parts: the homepage, where we present our offer, and the test page, 
where users can solve an English language test.

### Technology used
Writing the application, I assumed that I would not make extensive use of additional libraries,
as I was asked to write in JS/HTML/CSS for the task.

While working on the project, I used ```live-server```, to launch the application. 
To start the application, you need to go to the ```QuickEnglish``` directory and launch live-server, which can be installed as follows:
```
npm install -g live-server
```

### Design
Before writing the application, I created a preliminary visual design of the test in Figma:
```https://www.figma.com/file/xupsTSRnXhItzJXiDt7Xfq/QuickEnglish?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=YGIxs2DXP65b1eTa-1```

Additionally, I created graphics and a logo.

### How it should be done

> Incorporation of additional libraries and frameworks to speed up development and improve code readability.

> In the real world, a significant portion of the logic should be on the backend, primarily the logic for checking the correct answer.

> An additional feature would be to read the test state of a logged-in user after closing the browser window.  

> Improved responsiveness.

> Routing between components.

### How it looks now
